    <p>To my dear dog, Toffee:</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm sorry I haven't come home in a while, I'm sure you must be worried about where I am and what I'm doing.</p>
    <p>I assure you I will come home as soon as possible; when I can give you my full divided love and attention.</p>
    <p>I miss you everyday, my sweet little munchkin and I hope you feel the same as well.</p>
    <p>I hope Mom is taking care of you well while I'm not around; you better protect her as well.</p>
    <p>Just know that I love you always, you and Mom, continue to stay safe.</p>
    <br>
